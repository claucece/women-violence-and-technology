# Gender-Based violence using technology

This is a repository to list the different organizations that are
currently working on understanding how gender-based violence is enhanced
through the usage of technology. It is also a place to list the different
studies and research that is already out there.

This is the first step towards research around gender-based violence, and
to the generation of ideas that will help to minimize it and that will help to
increase the safety and security of groups targeted by this violence.
